refirststory_28ed10a0		Class starts and [d] returns to class, unaware of what has happened. 	game/script.rpy	468	"[what]"
refirststory_3c8b6e50		[abc] see you acting like this and don't go back to doing so later. 	game/script.rpy	470	"[what]"
refirststory_d807aa06		Well done, you stopped a bullying session in advance.	game/script.rpy	472	"[what]"
refirststory_13a75801		But perhaps you could have just cautioned them not to do such a thing, otherwise they might have continued to do so if you hadn't been there.	game/script.rpy	474	"[what]"
refirststory_a20cefa7_6		...	game/script.rpy	476	"[what]"
refirststory_8bb657b4		You see them huddled around there and after a while smiling and leaving.	game/script.rpy	488	"[what]"
refirststory_a20cefa7_7		...	game/script.rpy	492	"[what]"

refirststory_43be78bc	d	"Thank you."	game/script.rpy	526	d "[what]"
refirststory_5806ba59		Suprisingly, [chars[]3[2]] doesn't look very angry, as if [chars[]3[2]]'s used to this sort of thing.	game/script.rpy	530	"[what]"
refirststory_51e99a8a		And [chars[]3[2]] asks for his homework back from those people afterwards.	game/script.rpy	532	"[what]"
refirststory_a20cefa7_8		...	game/script.rpy	534	"[what]"
refirststory_4c378b1e		Just because [chars[]3[2]] seems to be used to it doesn't mean it won't hurt [chars[]3[4]].	game/script.rpy	536	"[what]"
refirststory_6047b2c4		Maybe you can try to stop it happening in advance next time.	game/script.rpy	538	"[what]"
refirststory_97d755ac		Let's try it again!	game/script.rpy	540	"[what]"

resecondstory_669023f1	a	Huh? Why?	game/script.rpy	806	a "[what]"
resecondstory_f583fbc4	pov	Look, [chars[]2[2]] never buys drinks, only drinks water, but you have coke everyday.	game/script.rpy	808	pov "[what]"
resecondstory_122e2319	pov	That's a lot of sugar you know.	game/script.rpy	810	pov "[what]"
resecondstory_375ef5d2	a	...Make sense...Wait, but last time I gave [chars[]2[4]] a can of coke and [chars[]2[2]] took it, which means [chars[]2[2]] also drinks it right?	game/script.rpy	814	a "[what]"
resecondstory_9c710e11	c	Haha...	game/script.rpy	816	c "[what]"

resecondstory_a20cefa7_8		...	game/script.rpy	836	"[what]"
resecondstory_a2447aae		However, the longer you know [chars[]2[4]], the more you think [chars[]2[3]] family might not be well off.	game/script.rpy	838	"[what]"
resecondstory_996aadd2	a	Let's have a group, shall we? We can share homework there.	game/script.rpy	844	a "[what]"

resecondstory_a64454b2		After a while, you find that [chars[]2[2]] often doesn't join in your conversations, and [chars[]2[2]] doesn't attend the usual gatherings at all.	game/script.rpy	901	"[what]"
