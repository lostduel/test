Greetings! Welcome to the game.
As you already know, this game is an interactive fiction, and I hope that after playing, you can learn something from it.
Now first, please enter your name:
Hello, [povname]!
The game has four small stories, they each have a number of options.
Please be careful, your choices will influence the direction of the story
Chapter one
You are a high school student
One day between classes, you are sitting in your seat looking at your mobile phone and gradually feel the noise of a group of people talking next to you 
Hahaha I think it's great! 
I agree hahaha.. 
Although they are noisy, you choose to remain in the classroom as it is almost time for class. 
At this point, you faintly hear them mention [d]'s name. 
[d] was a student in your class whom you didn't know very well but you remember well because [chars[3][2]] has a birthmark on [chars[3][3]] face
{size=-10}...tease...take...homework...{/size}
You seem to hear something.
Hahahahaha...
Their laughter is somewhat gloating.
After a while, [d] returns to the classroom and you see the three people immediately return to their seats, but there is some eye contact.
You feel something is wrong, but fortunately you have [d]'s contact details.
"Hey dude, I just heard that some people seem to be trying to do something about your homework. "
"Huh? What are they going to do? "
"I'm not really sure, but you should be careful anyway."
"Oh, Ok, thanks."
After class, you are relieved to see him out the door with his homework. 
At lunch, you feel really happy because you helped a classmate.
However, when you return to class, you find [d] anxiously rummaging through [chars[3][3]] bag. 
You walk over.
What's happened?
 I can't find my wallet, I put it in my bag and it was gone when I came back from dinner. 
...
You think it's the same people who did it and you're a bit angry.
What I told you before was planned by [abc], and I think they took your wallet too. 
What's wrong with them? why are they doing this? I need to talk to them. 
...
They are a little surprised to see you approaching. 
What's the matter?
Did you take my stuff? 
Huh? What's that? 
My wallet.
No, why would you think we took it?
Stop pretending, I heard what you said before.
Oops, you've got great hearing. 
Then there's nothing we can do if we're overheard. 
With that [chars[0][2]] walks to the corner of the classroom and takes out the wallet.
Don't do that again, it's stealing, okay? 
Don't be so serious, it's just a joke you know.
Do you think we find it funny? 
Forget it.
[d] drags you away. 
Back in [chars[3][3]] seat, [chars[3][2]] looks a bit down in the dumps 
Thank you.
It's what I should do.
With that [chars[3][2]] gets up and walks out of the classroom and waited until class was over before returning. 
Well done for stepping up to the plate!
Keep going!
Not knowing what they want, you leave them alone for the time being. 
After class, [d] goes out and you see the three of them gather around. 
You don't feel right. 
You walk over.
What are you playing? Can I join in?
Er..no? We're not playing anything.
Yeah, yeah, we're just talking. 
They look a little embarrassed and don't look directly at you.
I actually heard you guys talking about it earlier and I don't think it's good behavior to poke fun at other people like that.
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Are you gonna take [chars[3][3]] homework?
...
This is already considered theft. 
...We won't do it again, don't you tell him.
Don't do this to others either.
Well......
With that they leave and you return to your seat.
d returns to the classroom near the beginning of class, but [chars[3][2]] doesn't know what's going on.
Well done for stopping a bullying session that hadn't even happened yet, that's more likely to reduce the damage they cause.
Eh, so can I join you? 
Uh, nothing really, just thinking about homework.
Ah, I actually can't quite figure out how to write my homework, let's do it together!
Oh, oh well, then ...... it's almost time for class, so let's go back to our seats and have a look.
Yeah right, back to our seat for discussion.
So you go back to your seats and pretend to continue the discussion with them.
Class starts and [d] returns to class, unaware of what has happened. 
[abc] see you acting like this and don't go back to doing so later. 
Well done, you stopped a bullying session in advance.
But perhaps you could have just cautioned them not to do such a thing, otherwise they might have continued to do so if you hadn't been there.
Chapter two
A new class for a new semester, and a class that is still largely filled with people you don't know. 
You sit restlessly in your chair alone, looking for anyone you know.
Fortunately you see two of your former classmates [d] and [e], and you greet each other, but they are seated far away from you.
...
After the whole day, you get to know the people around you a little.
Hey, would you like to have dinner together? So that we can get to know each other better.
Good idea! I'd to have some chips!
Sure, sounds great.
..Sorry, I'm not available tonight.
That's fine, but you have to join us next time.
Haha, ok. Have fun.
...
...
You have a great meal with them, and you find that you are pretty enjoy spending time with them.
"It's a good start." You think to yourself.
...
For the next few days, you live a normal school life.
In most time, you stay with classmates sit around you like lunch or rest time, but you also have chat or play with [d] and [e] sometimes.
...
[c], why are you eating this again?
Err, I just like it...
Spaghetti fanatic? You should have some meat and vegetables, it's not healthy.
Well, But I think [chars[2][2]]'s healthier than you.
Huh? Why?
Look, [chars[2][2]] never buys drinks, only drinks water, but you have coke everyday.
That's a lot of sugar you know.
...Make sense...Wait, but last time I gave [chars[2][4]] a can of coke and [chars[2][2]] took it, which means [chars[2][2]] also drinks it right?
Haha...
You notice [c] smiling awkwardly.
But still much less than you.
Wait and see, I'll drink diet coke from tomorrow.
Haha, I bet you won't last two days.
...
...
However, the longer you know [chars[2][4]], the more you think his family might not be well off.
Let's have a group, shall we? We can share homework there.
Oh that's great, we should add friends first.
Everyone takes their phone out, except [c].
[c], is there anything wrong? What's your account?
[c]@hmail.com
...
Alright, got it, you need to accept my apply.
Ah, ok.
Finally [chars[2][2]] takes phone out.
Wow, is it jphone6 or 6s? I miss it so much!
It is, it's been six years?
Yeah...my mom used it.
All done, I've added you all, I'll create a group.
...
Also, [chars[2][2]] barely change [chars[2][3]] clothes.
After a while, you find that [chars[2][2]] often doesn't join in your conversations, and [chars[2][2]] doesn't attend the usual gatherings at all.
Gradually, people stopped inviting [chars[2][4]] to after-school activities
...
After a month.
One day, after the class and you are ready to go for lunch.
At the moment, [c] is discussing a problem with the teacher and you are waiting for [chars[2][4]] to join you.
Let's go to the canteen.
[pov], hurry up or there will be a queue later
Oh, ok. alright.
You're a bit surprised they didn't wait for [c]. You wonder if [c] said ahead of time for us to go first or if [chars[2][2]]'s not going to lunch today.
...
By the time you have served your meal and sat down to eat, you notice that [c] has come to the canteen alone and has found a seat to eat alone.
You are a little confused.
Why does [c] go to lunch alone?
Because [chars[2][2]] doesn't have anyone else to eat with, right?
So why not come to us?
Maybe [chars[2][2]] has found out that we don't want to eat with [chars[2][4]].
Huh? Why? 
Don't you think [chars[2][2]] can't actually play with us?
Does [chars[2][2]]?
[c] never goes out with us, [chars[2][3]] phone doesn't support the latest games, and [chars[2][2]] doesn't join in with the usual conversation.
Huh...
You don't know what to say and eat in silence.
...
After eating and returning to class, [c] come back a while later, but [chars[2][2]] doesn't ask where you had gone to eat. 
It's as if [chars[2][2]]'s used to being treated this way, when in fact you think back and [chars[2][2]]'s never initiated a conversation with you. 
But [chars[2][2]] was very willing to respond when you approached [chars[2][4]] to talk, it didn't seem like [chars[2][2]] didn't want to talk to you. 
You decide to...
...
The next day at noon.
You guys go ahead and eat today, I have something to do.
And with that you walk out of the classroom. 
When [a] and [b] have left, you go back to the classroom. 
Want to go to dinner together? 
You speak to [c].
Huh? Uh, yeah, let's go. 
So you go to the canteen together and pick a seat away from [a] and [b]. 
...
You eat your meal in peace. 
...
When you return to class, you notice that [a] and [b] look at you a bit strangely and don't offer to greet you. 
Feeling a little strange, you sit down and take out your phone and you find a message from [d]. 
"What's going on with you guys? I was sitting behind [a] and [b] just now and they seemed to be upset with you "
"Ah, maybe because I didn't go to lunch with them?"
"They said they just told you something yesterday and today you like this or something."
"...... I see, thank you."
You didn't expect them to find out and it was a bit embarrassing.
And the next day noon, they don't invite you and go for the lunch.
You don't have to do this, it's not worth losing a friend for me.
It's okay, I'd rather be with you.
...
...
For a week since then, [a] and [b] have stopped inviting you to their events, although you will have dinner with [c], and [d] and [e] will strike up a conversation with you. 
But sitting next to someone and not being able to communicate makes you uncomfortable.
So you become better with [chars[2][4]] and [chars[2][2]] becomes more forthcoming with you, but the rest of the class doesn't get on as well with you because of [a] and [b].
...
The next year, you are in different classes and you meet new classmates.
However, [c] doesn't meet anyone like you, and becomes alone again as before.
...
It's good for you to help a person like [chars[2][4]], but sometimes the power of one person is not enough.
Let's try it again!
Obviously it's better for you to be on good terms with [a] and [b].
So find a time when [c] isn't around.
Can I join you for lunch today?
[a] and [b] look at each other.
Sure.
Wise choice.
At noon, you go to lunch together.
When you see [c] eating alone at lunch time, you feel a bit bad but you can't do anything about it. 
Back in the classroom, [c] doesn't say anything to you, as if [chars[2][2]]'s already expecting this. 
...
That's how you get through a normal year. 
The following year, you move to different classes, meet new friends and [c] remains on [chars[2][3]] own. 
...
At least you tried, but sometimes it's hard to make the decision.
Let's try it again!
You can't take the risk of being isolated together.
You've had a normal year and are on friendly terms with most people, but you've been sorry in your heart for [c]. 
Every time you see [chars[2][4]] alone, you always feel like you should have done something about it, but it's too late.
The following year, you move to different classes and never speak to each other again. 
It's hard to take the risk, but maybe you can have a try.
Let's do it again.
You don't think you can handle this alone, so you call up [d] and [e] after class.
You tell them what's going on. 
......This kind of thing happens all the time, some people are like this.
I don't think people should isolate others just because of that.
Yes, so I wondered if I could help him. 
Yes, we haven't had any contact with [chars[2][4]] before and don't know about [chars[2][4]], but we're happy to have a try. 
En.
So the next day at noon.
You guys go ahead and eat today, I have something to do.
And with that you walk out of the classroom.
When [a] and [b] have left, you go back to the classroom. 
Want to go to dinner together? 
You speak to [c].
Huh? Uh, yeah, let's go. 
On the way.
You don't have to do this, you'll be isolated with them if you stay with me. 
What? Why do you say that? I just came back and saw you were still here so I asked you to come along. 
I see...
When you get to the canteen, after serving your meal you go straight to your friends.
He is somewhat surprised. 
They are all from our class, I were in same class with them last year too! 
Hi, my name is [d].
I'm [e].
Ah, hello! My name is [c].
You don't have to give up on yourself, we'd all like to be your friends 
...Thanks...
...
After that, you have lunch together every day, and you usually talk to [chars[2][4]].
Although [chars[2][2]] is still unable to participate in the after-school activities, this does not hinder your relationship.
The rest of the class is slowly becoming friends with [chars[2][4]] when they see how close you four are. 
Slowly he settles into the class. 
The next year, you're not in the same class, but you still keep in touch with [chars[2][4]].
He is grouped with some of the others in the class and they maintain the same good relationship and integrate into the new class.
Great job! You changed your friend's later life.
Chapter three
You are a computer science student, In this term, you have enrolled in a course with medical students and today, it is the first session of the course.
...alright, please follow the groupings on the screen and start your group discussion.
Introduce yourself first and choose a disease you interested.
...
After a while, all your group members are sit around the table, you find out that you don't know any of them.
Hi guys, I'm [a], and I'm major in Health Data Science.
I major is Health Data Science too, I'm [b], nice to meet you!
Me too, you can call me [c].
My name is [pov], I'm major in Computer Science. I'm not quite familiar with the medication field so maybe I need your help.
Haha, sure.
{size=-10}...Hello everyone, my name is [d], uhh I'm major in Biotechnology.{/size}
You find that it's really hard to hear [d]'s voice, maybe [chars[3][2]] is not good at speaking English.
So, then we need to choose a disease, right?
yeeeees. 
yeah.
right.
{size=-10}...yes.{/size}
any ideas?
{size=-10}...chronic pharyng...{/size}
how about COVID-19? It should be interesting to learn about it.
Oh that's good, I agree, how do you think?
Sounds great, and maybe we could get more marks since it's a new disease.
*Nod
You think [chars[0][2]]'s got a point.
{size=-10}..But I heard teacher say it's better to choose a uhhhh chronic disease, COVID-19 may not be proper...{/size}
Oh yes, the teacher did say that, I almost forgot.
Forgot what?
Meanwhile, both [b] and [c] looking at you in confusion.
[d] just said we should choose a chronic disease, right?
Perhaps you sit next to [d], so you are the only one noticed [chars[3][3]] voice.
{size=-10}..Yes, it's what teacher said...{/size}
Oh, Ok, so any other ideas?
{size=-10}...I'm a little bit interested in chronic pharyng...{/size}
How about Rheumatoid Arthritis? My grandpa has this disease, so I want to learn something about it.
Cool! He would be so proud of you! How do you think? I'd like to do this.
{size=-10}Ah, sure, good idea...{/size}
I think it's pretty good.
Let's do it!
In order to communicate after the class, you friended each other on social media platforms and created a group.
[a], [b] and [c] seem to be very chatty, while you and [d] just say hello politely.
...
After dinner, you decide to do something.
I can't wait to watch the Love, Death & Robots 2! It's must be better than season 1!
...
Let me see if I can find anything on Google..
Rheumatoid Arthritis...enter
Oh, there's a lot of useful information, I have to note them down..
Alright, they can save us a lot of time...
Ok them, it's time to rest?
I can't wait to watch the Love, Death & Robots 2! It's must be better than season 1!
...
I wonder if they searched the information as well.
{image=phone.png}"Hey guys, I found some information about the Rheumatoid Arthritis, hope it can help."
{image=phone.png}"Oh sweet! You are so hardworking! We are still having party with [b] and [c]! I'll check them later!"
{image=phone.png}"LOL, Have fun!"
{image=phone.png}"I found some too, you can check as well."
{image=phone.png}"https://www.nice.org.uk/... It's about causes of disease"
 "https://www.versusarthritis.org/... basic information"
 "https://www.... treatment"
 "......"
{image=phone.png}"OMG that's too much, you're amazing!"
{image=phone.png}"Thank you haha,,"
You spend a lot of time to look them through, and surprisingly, they are all very useful.
...
A week later
Today is your second session of the class, and you have a group conversation after the lecture as well.
Wow, it's been a week, so what we need to do today?
We should summarise the information we found.
{size=-10}...we also need to plan our uhhh swimlane diagram, I'll send an example to the group ...{/size}
Ok! Summarise..summarise, what we have right now? Oh, let me check our group...
[a] start to use [chars[0][3]] phone.
You haven't seen them yet? It's already a week.
I was drunk! And I totally forgot them.
Alright alright, we can do it now.
Actually I have read them so maybe I can help, and [d] has already written the content after the link.
{size=-10}...yeah, these are easy to summarise, so I'll just write them out...{/size}
Oh [povname] you are so kind! Let's begin..
...
Oh this artical gonna be useful, there is a lot of data.
Yeah, and this one as well. We don't need to find them ourselves, lucky!
{size=-10}...uhhh it's only half an hour left, I think we need to talk about the swim..uhh..diagram...{/size}
How about this? It describes some symptoms, I think it's pretty complete.
Indeed, they all can be used in our report.
Well..I think we can do it latter, and talk about our swimlane diagram?
Oh! Thank you for the reminder, (*Look at the clock), we need to hurry up! Come on, [b], [c], let's do it first.
Uhhh, What is swimlane?
{size=-10}...It's a kind of , ehhh, flowchart, I have sent one in the group...{/size}
I see! Look, I found an example.
You find that [c]'s example is exactly the same as [d]'s
...
It's quite a coincidence haha.
What coincidence?
Look, [c] has showed the same picture as [d].
...Wow, quite a coincidence indeed.
Alright, now we know what it looks like, so...I think we first have to decide how many phases we need?
Well, if we go to the hospital, we need to do some examinations first?
{size=-10}...maybe we need to make an appointment...{/size}
Yup, and then the doctor will diagnose us with the result.
Then comes the treatment phase?
Exactly, do we need to include appointments?
Oh yes, It should include all parts.
...
You notice [d] seems like [chars[3][2]] wants to say something, but in the end [chars[3][2]] didn't say anything.
Perfect, then what roles do we need?
Who do we have to make an appointment with?
Nurse?
And we can also do it on website, I remember our teacher said we should think about the data part as well, that's why I am in this group haha.
Yeah, make sense.
...
...You continue the discussion, but [d] doesn't participate anymore and is taking some notes on [chars[3][3]] own
This evening, you start to work on that swimlane.
Looking at the notes you took, you decide to...[x]
You think you have had enough discussion for the afternoon and start drawing swimlane diagram from your notes.
It's quite easssssy, I've already got all the phases and roles, just link them togeter...
...
Wait, what podiatrist gonna do...I forgot to note that down...
...
OMG there are too many lines here, I have to separate them a bit...
...
Can't these boxes be fixed in the grid? I have to put them in everytime I resize the grid!
...
...
Alright! I'm done today, counting on you, tomorrow's me!
...
...
...
{image=phone.png}"..Are you there?"
Suddenly [d] sends you a message
{image=phone.png}"Yeah, what's up?"
Two days later.
Finally...before the deadline...
Now just upload it...
I've drawn up all the discussion, so I should get high marks, right?
Forget it, that's it! I can at last get back to watching my Love, Death & Robots 2!
You are worried about missing something and suggest in the group that you want to do it together.
{image=phone.png}"Hi guys, do you want to finish the swimlane together? I'm afraid I've missed some points"
{image=phone.png}"Sure, but I think we have alreally found them all."
{image=phone.png}"Come on! Believe in ourselves, just follow the note and we will get good grades."
{image=phone.png}"Lol I hope so."
...
...
{image=phone.png}"..Are you there?"
Suddenly [d] sends you a message
{image=phone.png}"Yeah, what's up?"
Two days later.
Finally...before the deadline...
Now just upload it...
I've drawn up all the discussion, so I should get high marks, right?
Forget it, that's it! I can at last get back to watching my Love, Death & Robots 2!
{image=phone.png}"Hi, are you there?"
You send a message to [d]
{image=phone.png}"I am, is there anything wrong?"
{image=phone.png}"Yeah...I'm just not sure about our diagram.."
{image=phone.png}"I don't know, but I'm afraid we missed something..."
{image=phone.png}"I agree..."
{image=phone.png}"..Really? I think it's pretty good. I'll just follow what we discussed."
{image=phone.png}"Oh really? I'm relieved then, thank you."
{image=phone.png}"...Never mind..."
Two days later.
Finally...before the deadline...
Now just upload it...
I've drawn up all the discussion, so I should get high marks, right?
Forget it, that's it! I can at last get back to watching my Love, Death & Robots 2!
Week three
...Well, that's it for today's lesson, if you have any more questions you can come and see me later.
The rest of the discussion time is reserved for you to discuss your presentations and PPTs for next week. 
By the way, I have finished looking at all the swimlane diagrams you submitted from last week, the grading and rubric will be uploaded to the website by Thursday. 
...
Hey, How are your swimlanes?
Easy peasy, I just spent a day on it.
Me too, we've had enough discussions, haven't we?
Well, I'm still not familiar with the medical field and it still took me a few days
Let's see how many points we can score
We gonna win this!
...
...
{image=phone.png}"Jesus, I just got 50...the teacher said I missed a big part!"
{image=phone.png}"Me too! Why?? We should have found them all!"
{image=phone.png}"I don't understand, I'll talk to him."
You find your grade is not good as well.
You didn't say anything, so as [d]...
The next day.
{image=phone.png}"I just asked the teacher about our diagram."
{image=phone.png}"He said we all missed relapse part, except [d]??"
{image=phone.png}"Why [chars[3][2]] didn' tell us??"
{image=phone.png}"Really? what the..."
{image=phone.png}"[chars[3][2]] is so selfish! We are in the one group, how could [chars[3][2]] did this??"
{image=phone.png}"..."
{image=phone.png}"Let's just leave [chars[3][4]], we can do well on ourselves!"
After this, you never talk to [d] again.
[d] has never joined the discussion since then, tt seems like there are only 4 of you in the group.
Things have gotten worse.
Oops! You don't seem to be very good at getting on with [d], maybe you need some opportunities to talk to him.
Let's try it again!
...
{image=phone.png}"I think they missed a big part..."
{image=phone.png}"Rheumatoid arthritis is not a disease that can be easily cured and I have looked into it before and found that many patients have relapses"
{image=phone.png}"Oh really?? I totally missed it.."
{image=phone.png}"...Yeah, If our teacher is familiar with this or have looked it up like I did, he will have thought that our swimlane diagram would have had a relapse phase..."
{image=phone.png}"Oh my god...thank you very much...I certainly wouldn't have realised this if you hadn't warned me."
{image=phone.png}"It's okay, after all, you've helped me before..."
{image=phone.png}"Have I? I just did what I felt I had to do."
{image=phone.png}"At least I know someone will listen to me."
{image=phone.png}"Because what you said does make a lot of sense."
{image=phone.png}"...Thank you..."
Wait...What would happen if they found out we were the only two who scored higher...I don't think anything good will come of it...
Should I remind [chars[3][4]]?
{image=phone.png}"Do you want to tell them about this? I am sure they will be very grateful to you"
After a while
{image=phone.png}"...Well, if you want, but I don't think they'll thank me anyway..."
{image=phone.png}"At least I'll thank you for them."
...
{image=phone.png}"Hey guys, I just discussed with [d] and [chars[3][2]] found something I think is really important."
{image=phone.png}"To be honest, I think I would have failed this assignment if [chars[3][2]] hadn't warned me"
You send a screenshot of your conversation with [d]
{image=phone.png}"Wait what is it, relapse? Really?"
{image=phone.png}"Holy..that's close..."
{image=phone.png}"[d] said [chars[3][2]] is not good at communication but it's really important for our group, so [chars[3][2]] asked me to tell you about this."
{image=phone.png}"And I think we should discuss about our roles again, what do you think, [d]?"
{image=phone.png}"...You don't have to do this..."
[chars[3][2]] send you a personal message.
{image=phone.png}"You deserve it, they should know what you did."
{image=phone.png}"..Alright..."
{image=phone.png}"..Actually is not only relapse, some medicines for rheumatoid arthritis can cause some other symptoms."
{image=phone.png}"Like lung infection, which is a common side effect, so we need to add Pulmonologist."
{image=phone.png}"Make sense."
{image=phone.png}"And Orthopedist is also required, ..."
...
...
After a long discussion
{image=phone.png}"...You are right, we did miss a lot of things."
{image=phone.png}"Haha, although [chars[3][3]] voice is relatively low and you may not notice it, I sat next to [chars[3][4]] and I found that the points [chars[3][2]] made were important."
{image=phone.png}"..Well, I just have time to read more articles about it..."
{image=phone.png}"No, you've really helped, thank you very much."
{image=phone.png}" I will take your thoughts more seriously in the future."
{image=phone.png}"...I'll try my best"
...
...
{image=phone.png}"Hey! I've seen my results! I can't believe it! I've never gotten a score above 90!"
{image=phone.png}"Me too! It's crazy! It all thanks to [d]."
{image=phone.png}"*Similing We all did a good job."
{image=phone.png}"You saved us."
{image=phone.png}"Accept our thanks! We can't do this without you."
{image=phone.png}"..ok.ok, and thank you all,,,"
...
...
After this, the group always pays more attention to what [chars[3][2]] has to say and will take the initiative to ask [chars[3][4]] what [chars[3][2]] thinks.
He gradually settled into the group and is able to speak more naturally.
You become very good friends.
Good job! You've made every choice right.
Hope you do as well in the rest of the story
{image=phone.png}"I'm not sure...I don't think they will pay attention to it, so just keep it between us maybe better..."
{image=phone.png}"Never mind! It's all up to you. Thank you anyway!"
{image=phone.png}"You are welcome."
...
...
{image=phone.png}"Jesus, I just got 50...the teacher said I missed a big part!"
{image=phone.png}"Me too! Why?? We should have found them all!"
{image=phone.png}"I don't understand, I'll talk to him."
You didn't say anything, so as [d]...
The next day.
{image=phone.png}"I just asked the teacher about our diagram."
{image=phone.png}"He said we all missed relapse part, but you and [d] did not??"
{image=phone.png}"Why you didn' tell us??"
{image=phone.png}"Calm down, calm down. [d] told me about this but I'm not sure it's right or not, so..."
{image=phone.png}"We could discuss about it, right?"
{image=phone.png}"My bad, I'll tell you next time, I promise."
If you had listened to [chars[3][4]] before...
After this, nothing has changed among the group.
You are the only one who talk to [d], and [chars[3][2]] doesn't really fit in with the group.
You are still the same.
Not bad! You become a friend of [d], but maybe you can do it better, can't you?
Let's try it again!

Not bad! You become a friend of [d], but maybe you can think about how to handling interpersonal relationships, can't you?
Let's try it again!
...
Chapter four
Usually you live in a student residence with three roommates.
Although you have your own bedrooms, you share bathroom, toilet and kitchen and often chat in the common areas.
You are in the room on the far side, [a]'s room is next to yours, then [b]'s and finally [c]'s.
One day after dinner, you sit in the sofa chat together.
Have you heard about supercall's new game? It looks so cool!
Oh really? I've seen its promotional video before and was quite interested.
Yes! We can play it next week, let's do it together!
Sure, how about you two?
It sounds interesting, but we are both working on our group work you know, maybe after that?
It's reaaaaally hard, I'm so jealous you didn't take this course.
Haha! This is where the importance of prior research comes into play.
Well, actually my course is kind of hard too, it's all about medication and I know nothing about it!
I'm particularly scared of it now for assigning homework, I might have to spend ages on it.
So why on earth did you choose that?
It looked easier than the others at the time, but I've changed my mind now.
God bless you bro.
Speaking of which, were you singing in the room yesterday?
Oops, you heard that? That's so awkward...
You know the soundproof here sucks, but you're actually quite good at singing, don't worry.
Wow, I want to hear you sing! Come on!
Wait, hold on hold on...Why did the topic change here???
Now this is your stage, please.
Alright alright...
...
...
A week later at the same time
Hey [b], I can't try that game tomorrow, my teacher just assigned a new homework, and I have absolutely no idea on how to do that.
No worries, I've asked some of my friends to join me and I'll definitely carry you when you're done with your homework.
Of course, I'm counting on you.
Now it's your turn! We're almost done.
Nooooo!
...
Second day
After dinner, you went back to the dormitory, but [b] is not in the kitchen as usual.
Where is [b]?
Flew back to room right after the dinner.
{size=-10}...watch out!...{/size}
*Sigh Now you hear [chars[1][4]], that game seems so attractive.
I want to try that too...I need to hurry up.
Good luck dude, I've heard [chars[1][4]] screaming in the house all day, I'm even tempted to give it a go.
Stop seducing me, I can't resist it!
{size=-10}.....good job!......{/size}
Haha alright, do your homework then.
Roger that sir.
{size=-10}......kidding me? What the .... are you doing??...{/size}
You shrug at them and walk back to your room.
...
12p.m.
{image=phone.png}"Holy moly...you're still playing the game."
{image=phone.png}"I remember you have class tomorrow morning, right?"
...
Next day, you find their chat after you sleeping.
1 a.m.
{image=phone.png}"Come on! It's the first day, I have to work hard."
{image=phone.png}"...OK...But if you spend that time studying, you wouldn't fail the course"
{image=phone.png}"Don't be so mean *Cry"
{image=phone.png}"G9, I'll get back to playing!"
{image=phone.png}"*Sigh I hope I could..."
Why is [a] up this late? It's not like [chars[0][4]].
You whisper and mutter.
...
After washing up you walk out of the room, only [a] and [c] is having their breakfast.
Morning! Did [b] go to school already?
*Yawn Maybe [chars[1][2]] is still dreaming about [chars[1][3]] game.
Really? What time did he sleep yesterday?
After 3 a.m.? I'm not sure...*Yawn It wouldn't be very early anyway.
Jesus, it's crazy.
Who says it isn't?
After the breakfast, [b] still doesn't show up, so you go to school without [chars[1][4]].
12 p.m.
{image=phone.png}"Jeez, I've slept in!"
{image=phone.png}"Good morning! How is your course?"
{image=phone.png}"Let me check..."
...
{image=phone.png}"Oh shoot, teacher has called the roll!!"
{image=phone.png}"Congrats."
{image=phone.png}"And I have to turn in my homework today!!"
{image=phone.png}"You have to pray that the teacher is still at school."
{image=phone.png}"GTG"
{image=phone.png}"Good luck lol"
...
At dinner, you four sit together.
Dit you find the teacher?
Thank god yes, but the teacher said it's the last time, so if I do it again I maybe fail the course..
Can I say you deserve it?
Well...
So how about the game? 
Wonderful! I haven't been such excited for years. supercall is the god! 
Then are you gonna play all night today?
Won't be that long, but i dont have to get up early tomorrow, so i need to take the chance!
Well, i have to though. *Yawn
you look so sleepy, why you sleep that late yesterday? 
*Sigh Not a big deal, hope it won't last too long... 
You dont quite understand, but you choose not to look deeper.
After the dinner, [b] rush to the room again, and soon [chars[1][3]] voice come out again.
...
Second day, you find their chat again
2:27 a.m.
{image=phone.png}"Do your friends stay up at night too?"
2:53 a.m.
{image=phone.png}"They are not in UK lol, they just finished their dinner."
{image=phone.png}"Jeez I forgot that...I thought your friends were planning to skip school too."
3:09 a.m.
{image=phone.png}"It was an accident! I didn't plan that."
{image=phone.png}"So you planned to sleep just 4 hours yesterday?"
{image=phone.png}"I planned to catch up on sleep in class lol."
{image=phone.png}"But I was so tired that I forgot to set my alarm clock"
{image=phone.png}"Why are you both awake, don't you need to get up at morning?"
{image=phone.png}"You guess..."
{image=phone.png}"Guess what?"
{image=phone.png}"g9"
{image=phone.png}"g9!"
...
You become more confused, but both [a] and [c] went to school, so you decide to ask after dinner.
Surperisingly, [b] is the only one have dinner at kitchen, and you need to do your homework, so you go back to your room.
Saturday, after you waking up, you find another chat.
1 a.m.
{image=phone.png}"Come on dude, you know the soundproof here not good right? @[b]"
1:13 a.m.
{image=phone.png}"Oh sorry, did I disturb you?"
{image=phone.png}"It’s been 3 days…"
{image=phone.png}"Sorry I didn’t mean to do that, you should tell me in the first day!"
{image=phone.png}"I thought it won’t last too long…"
{image=phone.png}"I’m not trying to stop you from playing, but your scramming is reaaaally loud…"
{image=phone.png}"Got that, I will definitely pay attention to that, sorry bro."
{image=phone.png}"It’s ok, I know you didn’t mean to it."
Oh…that’s it, I finally got it…
It’s good to see them have solved it peacefully though,,,.
So you decide to focus on your homework for now.
So you decide to focus on your homework for now.
after the weekend, you finally finish your homework, and you have time to chat with your roommates. 
As "usual", [b] does not join you, you decide to 
You talk about your daily life as before, mostly about your courses.
I saw your chat on Friday night, how's it going on?
Just like I said, [chars[1][2]] was so noisy at night, and I could barely sleep those days.
I thought it would be just first one or two days after that game releasing, but [b] kept scramming, so I had to tell [chars[1][4]].
Well...that must be a hard time, I'm so sensitive to noise too, luckily I don't live next to [chars[1][4]]...
That's so terrible...you will never know when [chars[1][2]] would jumpscare you!
So what's the situation now?
Much better...at least [chars[1][2]] will not yell all the time, but still sometimes when [chars[1][2]] is excited, so I still get woken occasionally.
Haha...how about [c]? Don't you have this problem?
Not that severe, but still a little bit annoying...I can't totally ignore that though.
May you both sleep well in the future.
I wish I could...We have an exam on Friday morning, we need to rest well..
After this, you chat for a while and then go back to the room.
Nothing much happened during this time, you lived your lives as usual.
Until Friday.
12 a.m.
{image=phone.png}"@[b] Dude I told you we have exam tomorrow right?? And you said you won't play today"
{image=phone.png}"I didn't want to play, but my friends kept asking me to join them and I was doing my best not to make a sound.."
{image=phone.png}"Please do better."
{image=phone.png}"Alright."
2:15 a.m.
{image=phone.png}"I've had enough of this, is it so hard not to disturb others?"
{image=phone.png}"You don't know how to keep your word?"
{image=phone.png}"I'm ashamed to be in a school with people like you."
...
...
There's a lot more left, all of which is [c] speaking to [b].
You are scared, right now, you decide to:
You think you'd better not get involved in the conflict, so you say nothing.
You send a message to [b] and ask [chars[1][4]] what happened, but apparently [chars[1][2]] is still sleeping at this time, so you wash up first and have a breakfast.
You go to the kitchen and find that [a] and [c] have already finished their meal and are cleaning up, they look very sleepy.
Morning, we need to go, see you at dinner.
Oh, yes, see you.
[c] waves to you and leaves
They are going to take the exam, guess I'll just have to wait for b to wake up...
...
...
Around midday
{image=phone.png}"IDK actually...I didn't make much noise last night for sure..."
{image=phone.png}"But [c] looked totally pissed off..."
{image=phone.png}"I have no idea! [chars[2][2]] have never told me about this!"
{image=phone.png}"It's always [a], I thought [c] didn't care about this."
{image=phone.png}"Maybe [c] just didn't say it...and you pushed [chars[2][4]] too hard this time..."
{image=phone.png}"You're right...but I'm sure I was very quiet yesterday, but a person will always make sound you know.."
{image=phone.png}"I was not there so I can't judge that..."
...
...
You take a look at the time and think [a] and [c] should have their breakfast right now, so you wash up quickly and go to the kitchen.
They are still eating, so you ask them directly.
What happened yesterday? You looked so angry.
I was very angry, [a] had told [chars[1][4]] to keep quiet just for yesterday, and [chars[1][2]] had promised.
But [chars[1][2]] still played for a long time and made plenty of noise.
I was doing my best to stay calm, but [chars[1][2]] went too far.
I understand...
We got to go, we have exam later.
OK, good luck.
...
...
So you go back to home and start your homework.
You send a message to [b] and ask [chars[1][4]] what happened, but apparently [chars[1][2]] is still sleeping at this time
So you go back to home and start your homework.
...
...
Around midday
{image=phone.png}"IDK actually...I didn't make much noise last night for sure..."
{image=phone.png}"But [c] looked totally pissed off..."
{image=phone.png}"I have no idea! [chars[2][2]] have never told me about this!"
{image=phone.png}"It's always [a], I thought [c] didn't care about this."
{image=phone.png}"Maybe [c] just didn't say it...and you pushed [chars[2][4]] too hard this time..."
{image=phone.png}"You're right...but I'm sure I was very quiet yesterday, but a person will always make sound you know.."
{image=phone.png}"I was not there so I can't judge that..."
...
...
Evening, you have dinner with [a] and [c].
Minutes later, [b] come back from school, and start to cook.
Evening.
[chars[1][2]] doesn't look very natural.
Evening, how's your school?
Not very good, I was so sleepy, maybe I should go to bed earier from today haha..
Yeah, it's a more healthy lifestyle.
Oh I'm so hungry, let me see what I can eat tonight...
[chars[1][2]] start to cook [chars[1][3]] dinner.
I finished, see you tomorrow.
Me too. see ya.
Ah, oh, see you, good night.
Good night
[a] and [c] look not want to stay, and leave very quickly.
...*Sigh
...
Well, I'll eat in my room.
Yeah, I'll go back then, bye.
...
The atmosphere is clearly not right, but they all go back to room, so you could do nothing here.
However, the situation has not improved after a week.
{image=phone.png}"Hey [pov], I found a good resturant, you have to go with us tonight."
{image=phone.png}"Sure, four of us?"
{image=phone.png}"You, me and [c]."
{image=phone.png}"OK"
Apprently they don't want to invite [b].
...
...
After a really good meal, you three go back to the kitchen.
[b] is having dinner.
Where were you going?
We went to a new resturant, it's really delicious.
Oh, great, I'll try next time.
[chars[1][2]] looks a little bit depressed.
...
...
School
{image=phone.png}"Wanna have lunch with us?"
{image=phone.png}"Yup, where are you?"
{image=phone.png}"Ground floor of canteen, right hand side of the entrance."
{image=phone.png}"Right there."
...
At canteen, while you're serving the meal
Yo, what's your lunch today?
Just some pasta, how about you?
Nah, not decide yet. You alone?
No, [c] asked me to join them.
..Alright, then I will eat it alone.
Uh, see you tonight.
...
Another day
You're having rest at kitchen with [b].
[a] opens the door
[pov] do you have any charge cable for iphone? My both devices are dead.
No, I onlt have a android device.
Huhhh, I'll ask the guy next door.
[a] go out of the kitchen.
...I have that cable, why don't [chars[0][1]] ask me?
...No idea.
...
And another day.
{image=phone.png}"Do anyone see my spoon? I put it on the table."
{image=phone.png}"It's not there? I just saw it."
{image=phone.png}"No, I didn't find it..."
...
{image=phone.png}"Oh I found it, it's under the sofa, wired."
Under the sofa? That's quite far from table...
I just had dinner with [a] and [c], there was no one else, it shouldn't happen anything like that...
....It shouldn't...
...
...
Two weeks later.
You are having lunch with [b].
...
Don't you think they're a bit too childish?
They just keep refusing to talk to me.
I don't know what they want, we live in a same suite, it can't solve anything.
And all of my stuffs, don't you suspect them of doing it? That's so wired.
I'm not sure...At least you don't have evidence..
But only they had the chance.
They just want to isolate me, but it's impossible, I have you and it's two versus two, right?
Haha, I hope it's better to be four together and without v.s.
...
A month later.
Although [b] is still eating and talking with you, it is clear that [chars[1][2]] is not as optimistic as [chars[1][2]] was before.
But still there's no any improvement between their relationship, or even worse.
At this point, you think you should...
You can't just wait like this, so you decide to make some changes.
To solve this, you need to talk with both sides.
Which side do you prefer to talk with first?
Whoever started the trouble should end it..
{image=phone.png}"Are you OK?"
{image=phone.png}"Yeah, why?"
{image=phone.png}"I just asking, actually I want to talk about that thing."
{image=phone.png}"Well...what happened suddenly?"
{image=phone.png}"It's been a month, I think there's nothing good to keep this way for all of us."
{image=phone.png}"...Yes..."
{image=phone.png}"..I want to help you, but we need to sort it out again."
{image=phone.png}"..Alright, let's find a place."
...
...
So you know what happened at first right?
Yes, because of playing at night?
It was [a] who always talked to me about that, but [c] never did, so I thought [a] was too sensitive, and I didn't cared about it much.
I thought it was fine until that night. I just played the game, and I swear I was not making noise. I was not to blame for the poor soundproof.
I don't know how they felt...but maybe you should stop playing just for that night?
From the results it really should be..I didn't think it would be this bad.
And I think I did do it wrong.
Have you apologised to them?
No, I have no opportunity at all, they don't talk to me.
Alright..maybe I could talk to them and find a way to solve this.
Thank you.
We are friends, right?
Sure.
...
...
Evening, after the dinner, you sit on the sofa with [a] and [c].
I talked with [b] today.
..? What?
Err, about that thing you know.
Oh, then? What did [chars[1][2]] say?
Well, [chars[1][2]] said [chars[1][2]] didn't realise at that time what trouble he was causing you.
And [chars[1][2]] wouldn't have done that if [chars[1][2]]'d known.
[chars[1][2]] knows [chars[1][2]] was wrong, and would like to apologise to you, but you have give [chars[1][4]] a chance.
Did [chars[1][2]] really say that?
Yeah, of course, face to face.
Well, I didn't expect that. But if it's [chars[1][3]] real thought, I can give it a try. How about you?
I had thought [chars[1][2]] had no intention of repenting at all...Since that's what he thinks, I agree.
Wonderful! Let's get some time together and talk?
OK.
En.
...
...
Well, we're all here.
The second day, all of you are sitting around the table.
It's been a long time huh.
Who says it isn't?
Alright, let's get to the point.
..Yes, so thank you for giving me this chance. And I have to apologise to you two.
I didn't know how annoyed I am, and I'm really sorry for what I did. I hope you can forgive me.
Now that you've apologized, of course we're willing to forgive you. But also we need to say sorry to you.
Yes, we know we also did something wrong to you. Whatever the reason, I'm sorry.
...
...
Finally, all the people in this room become friends again.
Well done! You saved your friendship and helped all of them.
See you in next chapter!
First I have to get [a] and [c] to be willing to talk...
Evening, after the dinner, you sit on the sofa with [a] and [c].
So you're still not going to forgive him?
Why should I? [b] doesn't deserve it.
Is that serious?
In ours view, yes. You know what happened, right?
Because of playing at night?
Yes, and [chars[1][2]] kept doing that after I had told [chars[1][4]] lots of times.
En...
Actually that's not the point.
What?
What I can't tolerate is [chars[1][3]] attitude, [chars[1][2]] didn't care what we say at all.
And [chars[1][2]] doesn't and [chars[1][2]] has no remorse at all, [chars[1][2]] doesn't think [chars[1][2]]'s wrong.
To this day [chars[1][2]] has not apologised to us, this is the point.
So we'll not forgive [chars[1][4]].
Just in case, did [chars[1][2]] say that [chars[1][2]] think [chars[1][2]] was wrong?
...
You reminisce for a moment.
No...
Then I have nothing else to say. We can't get along with such a person.
And I think you should drop the matter and leave it to us.
Huh...
...
...
Are you going to listen to [chars[2][4]]?
It was [b] who made the mistake in the first place, so [chars[1][2]] should have taken the initiative to deal with it
After the chat, you stay at your room.
No, if I leave it to them, they will never get back again...
{image=phone.png}"Hi. I have to tell you something."
{image=phone.png}"What's up?"
...
You tell [chars[1][4]] your conversation with [a] and [c].
{image=phone.png}"So they are waiting for your apology I think..."
{image=phone.png}"Are they serious? They were the ones who didn't talk to me."
{image=phone.png}"No way my friend, I know you did it for me, but they do not deserve it."
{image=phone.png}"They isolate me, and they even threw my stuff everywhere, and now they're blaming me?"
{image=phone.png}"Listen, just leave it, they are unreasonable."
...
{image=phone.png}"Come on! You know they just talked tough, right?"
...
{image=phone.png}"I'll think about it."
...
...
One day, you feel a little bit hungry when you are studying.
So you decide to get some snacks from fridge.
You take off the headphones, but before you open the door, you faintly hear some people speaking.
{size=-10}...so I apolopize....{/size}
{size=-10}.....we need to say sorry to......{/size}
{size=-10}.......should have found a better........{/size}
...
Somehow You feel really relieved.
Finally...
You sit back, and a moment later.
{image=phone.png}"Hi, I talked to them, and we're good now."
{image=phone.png}"Really?? Oh my god that's awesome!"
{image=phone.png}"We can finally play togeter again."
{image=phone.png}"Yes, and it all thanks to you."
{image=phone.png}"No, you did it yourself. Good job."
...
...
Finally, all the people in this room become friends again.
Well done! You saved your friendship and helped all of them.
See you in next chapter!
{image=phone.png}"I have decided."
{image=phone.png}"Alright..."
...
...
After this, they become even more conflicted.
You can't continue to live with them anymore.
So you decide to leave here.
You, [b], [a] and [c] become strangers.
...
Oops, it's not look great...Maybe you need to change your strategy.
Let's try it again!
...
{image=phone.png}"OK, I got it, if you insist."
{image=phone.png}"Thank you, but I can handle it."
{image=phone.png}"Alright..."
...
...
After this, they become even more conflicted.
You can't continue to live with them anymore.
So you decide to leave here.
You, [b], [a] and [c] become strangers.
...
Oops, it's not look great...Maybe you need to change your strategy.
Let's try it again!
...
It's a conflict between them, and it was [b] who made the fault first, so it's reasonable for [a] and [c] to do such a thing to [b].
And their conflict does not impact your relationship with both sides, so it's totally alright to keep this way.
Or you thought it will keep this way.
...
What should you do?
Two days later.
Morning, when you are still asleep, you faintly hear the sound of someone moving something outside.
Who is sorting things out?
You don't care too much on it, maybe it won't last long time.
...
...
However, it lasts over half an hour, and you can't fall asleep again due to the sound.
So you have to get up, and go out to check.
What are you doing?
Surprising, you find [b] is moving stuff out.
Oh, morning, Did I wake you up?
No, I just heard the sound and come to check. So..?
Ehh, just as you can see, I gonna leave here.
Leave? Why?
..Clearly there is no place for me here anymore, of course it's not your fault, and I have to thank you for the last month, or I would not have been able to stand it any sooner.
You don't have to leave, we can solve this.
I have talked with the doctor, and she said I should change my environment as soon as possible.
...
Sorry.
Why do you have to apologize, you did nothing wrong.
I could have done better, let me help you with these.
Thank you my friend.
...
You really regret it, but what you can do to change it..?
Let's try it again.
...
So you send messages to [a] and [c] to have a talk.
What has to come out and be said?
I think there's something wrong with [b], I saw [chars[1][4]] went to the psychological consultation room.
Wow, that's really surprised me.
What was your plan? Do you have thoughts of reconciliation?
Our reconciliation depends on [b].
Yes, you know that at first, we, or I discussed with [chars[1][4]] very gentle, right? But [chars[1][2]] didn't listen to me.
I talked with [chars[1][4]] about it two or three times? And [chars[1][2]] never cared about it.
After that night, [chars[1][2]] didn't apologise to us either, and [chars[1][2]] didn't even take it personally.
That's the point really pissed we off. And so we did something to [chars[1][4]].
We know that we may do it too far, but it's all because of [chars[1][4]].
Yeah...But [chars[1][2]]'s not in good condition right now, I'm afraid that something irreversible will happen if this situation continues...
Huh...But still, if he has no remorse whatsoever, we don't know how to get along with him.
However, If [chars[1][2]] could apologise to us, then we will do it as well for what we did, is that reasonable?
I agree..It may good for both sides...So I will talk to [chars[1][4]] about it tomorrow, I hope we could be what we used to.
I hope so.
...
One day, you are on your way home.
You notice [b] walk out of a building, but not the building where [chars[1][3]] classroom is.
What's that building for? [chars[1][2]] is not a person to hang around.
You walk closer, and find the Psychological Consultation Room written next to the front door
..Psychological consultation? What's going on?
You are not sure if [chars[1][2]] came here to consult, or if it's about that problem.
When you back to dorm, [b] is just like usual.
However, you can not ask [chars[1][4]] about the detail, since it related to privacy.
